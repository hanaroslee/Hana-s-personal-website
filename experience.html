        <p1>At first, I never thought of joining a program like this when I was in high school due to lack of transportation and time, but when I finished school, I thought that I should also take opportunities like giving the facilities to those in need. So, one day, I was scrolling my Twitter timeline, suddenly my eyes caught at a post from one of the students of Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia (UPNM) in expressing his gratitude and a picture of him serving homeless children in Jalan Tar, Kuala Lumpur. So, I directed message him and asked him to tell me more about the organization and finally he gave the phone number of the organizer who organized this charity organization. I got the name of this organization was Food for Homeless run by Uncle (his nickname). No strict rules because we only provide dry foods and facilities such as mask, sleeping mask, biscuits, toothbrush, book soap, shampoo, toothpaste, mineral water and many more that allow the homeless to eat and use it anytime without limited time. This event will be hold every Friday night from 10 pm to 2 am around the National Mosque, Jalan Tar, Jalan Silang and Bank area. So far, if I had any free time, I would indeed go either with my friend or my sister. My first experience was with the collaboration implemented by Food for the Homeless (FFG) with Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia (UPNM). I was able to spend my time in caring more about my surroundings. It is very heartwarming every time I join this event. I am still joining this program if I have free time and for your information, last week FFG collaborated with Universiti Malaya (UM) who came from students of UM. Lastly, I would like to state that I get to know people who are very kind, who care about others and have similar intentions with me. This experience has opened my eyes where there are still many stranded families or individuals who are more poor than ourselves. It makes me humble and more grateful for what I have now.</p1>

      <p2>I started from making it a hobby to becoming a real quick as a hockey player. The beginning of my journey as a hockey player during high school where at first I only played this hockey as my hobby if physical education time in school. One day while I was in form 3, a friend of mine who knew nothing about hockey, out of nowhere asked me to join her for an interview in choosing more player due to the lack of hockey players in my school. I had insisted on rejecting the wish because I was afraid of failing but I was still forced and eventually I had to agree on our friendship terms. So, one day in the afternoon at 5:30 pm, I met a more awesome and skillful hockey player than myself who only knew the basics. We trained for 3 hours following to the instructions from our professional coach, Coach Murshid. At the end of the time, I was announced accepted into my school hockey team, SMK Bukit Sentosa 2 because I was the strong in running but still weak in the game of hockey. So, I was told by Coach Murshid to come every afternoon everyday and be coached by him as well as other hockey players. I feel very happy because it is the first time for me to represent the school in sports. As long as I was accepted into this hockey team, I have been consistent with my training even though I was still weak and I was also diligent in watching the Malaysian Hockey team on television.</p2>
<br>
<br>    
      <p3>One day after training, Coach Murshid officially announced that there was a hockey match between schools in Hulu Selangor where I was selected as one of the school representatives and set the position as the last girl which is a defender. It made me feel like I was very lucky but at the same time, I was very scared to meet other school teams where I didn’t know them to find out their weaknesses. Next, on the day of our match, our team left from school to the Turf of SMK Pengkalan Permatang in Kuala Selangor at 7:30 am by bus. And we ended our day with an official announcement from the representative of the organizers where we got the title as the No. 3 winner. I felt so relieved. I really enjoyed my journey as a hockey player throughout form 3 until I finished school in form 5. I was able to upgrade myself for 3 years by seizing the opportunities for myself. I ended my journey as a hockey player with the best achievement where in 2018, my team got second place in hockey between schools in Hulu Selangor as a position right defender. In the same year, I was also selected under the Selangor Sports Council (MSS) program to represent the Hulu Selangor team against other hockey teams in Hulu Selangor. That was the best achievement I have ever had throughout my hockey life. For now, I haven’t stopped to play but I had to step aside because I don’t have an official team at the university. The benefits when I joined the team, I get to know more people from various races, places, religions and most importantly I also get to meet my role models which is the Malaysian Hockey Team. I am so thankful and I hope in the future I still get the chance to play hockey again.</p3>

<p4>On 16 January 2022, with the cooperation of all family members, a successful family day ceremony for the family of Abdul Rahman and Samsiah was held for the first time in history. Ideas and cooperation in launching this program, everyone participated. The name of the program was determined by my own mother, Family
    Day A.R - SAM 2022 located in my own village in Lambor Kanan, Perak. Due to the previous difficult movement order for us to get together, everyone felt excited and fun after all because we were finally able to get together as well. All my aunts and uncles returned to the village and finally we were able to bring back our habit where we, everyone always sleep together in the living room and we do not sleep because there were too many stories to tell to each other. We returned to the village with this program with intention, so there were many processes that took place in preparation due to last minute planning but thank God everything went smoothly. I want to tell the story because I was one of the backbone of the administration who manages all the affairs for this program with the help of my sisters and cousins. I also made tentative programs, planning activities that need to be implemented, as well as me who hosted throughout the event. The activities we provided were grabbing a chair, inserting a thread in a needle, looking for sugar cane in flour, filling water in a bottle using a sponge, water balloon, blowing balloons until it burst, scooping money using wok turner and exchanging gifts between aunts and uncles. The activities were so much fun that we did not stop laughing over and over. For the food, there were too much as everyone brought food from home and also we booked catering from my dad’s friend. All expressed satisfaction because of we had good foods. It gave me a very useful experience and I was happy to be able to take the opportunity to be an emcee for the first time. Throughout the program, I was constantly praised by my aunts and uncles because I dared to interact openly with the family and they said not everyone can do that stuff. At first it was a bit awkward but with the support of others, I was able to challenge myself. I was so happy.</p4>
